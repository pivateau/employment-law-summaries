# Race discrimination

The key legal principles underlying race discrimination in employment are primarily derived from federal laws, most notably Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Reconstruction Era Acts (specifically 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and § 1983), and state law, the Oklahoma Anti-Discrimination Act (OADA).

Here are the key principles:

- **Prohibition of Discrimination Based on Race:** Both federal and state laws explicitly prohibit discrimination in employment because of race. This protection extends to individuals of all races, including non-minority white employees. Discrimination based on "color," which refers to pigmentation, complexion, or skin shade/tone, is also prohibited by Title VII and can occur between persons of different races or the same race.
  
- **Scope of Prohibited Practices:** Race discrimination is prohibited in all phases of the employment relationship. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Hiring and refusing to hire.
  - Discharge/Termination.
  - Compensation/Pay.
  - Terms, conditions, privileges, or responsibilities of employment.
  - Training programs.
  - Promotion/Advancement.
  - Layoff.
  - Discipline.
  - Job assignments.
  - Benefits.
  - Transfers.
  - Limiting, segregating, or classifying employees in a manner that deprives them of employment opportunities or adversely affects their status.

- **Applicability to Employers:** The Oklahoma Anti-Discrimination Act (OADA) applies to **all public and private employers** in Oklahoma, including those with only one employee. Federal law, like Title VII, generally applies to employers with **15 or more employees**. The number of employees is considered an element of a plaintiff's claim under Title VII, not a jurisdictional issue.
- For many years, certain federal contractors had obligations regarding race under Executive Order 11246. While Executive Order 14173 effectively removed the requirement for federal contractors to implement affirmative action programs under EO 11246, employers remain subject to general anti-discrimination laws like Title VII.

## Theories for Proving Discrimination

Discrimination claims, including those based on race, can be proven using different legal theories:

- **Disparate Treatment:** This involves **intentional discrimination**where an employer treats individuals less favorably because of their race. Proof of discriminatory motive is critical, though it can sometimes be inferred. This is typically proven using the **three-step burden-shifting framework** established in _McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green_, where the plaintiff first establishes a prima facie case, the employer offers a legitimate non-discriminatory reason, and the plaintiff attempts to show that reason is a pretext for discrimination. Establishing a prima facie case requires showing membership in a protected class (race), suffering an adverse employment action, and circumstances inferring discrimination. The standard for an adverse employment action now requires showing only "some harm," a standard being applied in Oklahoma federal courts following the _Muldrow_ Supreme Court decision.
  
- **Disparate Impact:** This occurs when seemingly neutral policies, practices, or rules have a **disproportionate discriminatory effect** on a protected racial group, even without proof of intent to discriminate. Employers can defend against disparate impact claims by demonstrating that the practice is **job-related and consistent with business necessity**. However, the plaintiff can still prevail by showing that an equally valid, job-related alternative practice exists that causes less disparate impact. Statistical evidence is often used to demonstrate disparate impact.

- **Pattern or Practice:** This theory applies when employers engage in **systemic, routine, intentional discrimination** as part of their standard operating procedures.

- **Hostile Work Environment:** Racial harassment that is sufficiently **severe or pervasive** to alter the conditions of employment and create an **abusive working environment** is prohibited. Courts assess the environment from both an objective and subjective perspective, considering factors like the frequency and severity of the conduct. Conduct that appears facially neutral can support a hostile work environment claim if viewed in the context of other race-based behavior.

- **Reconstruction Era Acts:** The Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1871 provide additional protection against racial discrimination, notably through **42 U.S.C. § 1981** and **42 U.S.C. § 1983**.
  - **Section 1981** guarantees equal rights to make and enforce contracts, which includes employment contracts. Claims under § 1981 often accompany Title VII race discrimination claims. The standard for a hostile work environment claim under § 1981 is the same as under Title VII.
  - **Section 1983** applies when discriminatory acts are committed by a **public employer** acting under color of state law.
  - An advantage of bringing a claim under these acts is that it **frees claimants from the requirement of filing an administrative charge** with the EEOC or state agency, unlike Title VII or OADA claims. The statutes of limitations and available damages (including compensatory and punitive damages without Title VII caps for intentional discrimination under § 1981) can also differ favorably for the plaintiff.
- **Remedies:** Remedies available for race discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 include reinstatement, back pay (limited to two years prior), court costs, attorney fees, reinstatement of seniority, and injunctive relief. For cases of intentional discrimination, compensatory damages (including for future lost income, emotional pain, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonmonetary losses) and punitive damages are available, although there are statutory limits on these damages that are not revealed to the jury. Section 1981 also allows for compensatory and punitive damages.
- **Protection Against Retaliation:** Employees are protected from retaliation by an employer for opposing discriminatory practices or filing a charge of discrimination based on race. To prove retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that **"but for"** the protected activity, the adverse action would not have occurred; a mixed motive is not sufficient. The adverse action must be one that would deter a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity. This protection can extend to closely related third parties. While "after-acquired evidence" of employee misconduct may limit certain remedies like back pay, it does not eliminate liability for the discrimination itself.
- **Exclusive State Remedies:** The Oklahoma Anti-Discrimination Act (OADA) provides the **exclusive remedies within Oklahoma** for individuals alleging employment discrimination based on race (among other protected statuses). This means that any common law remedies, such as the _Burk_ tort cause of action, have been expressly abolished for these types of discrimination claims under state law. To file a claim under the OADA, a charge must be filed with the EEOC or the state administrative agency within 180 days of the alleged discrimination.
