# Sex discrimination

Based on the sources provided, the key legal principles underlying the law of sex discrimination in employment are derived primarily from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Oklahoma Anti-Discrimination Act (OADA), along with specific related laws like the Equal Pay Act and Pregnancy Discrimination Act.

Here are the core principles:

- **Fundamental Prohibition:** Both federal and state laws prohibit discrimination in employment based on sex. This means it is illegal for an employer to treat individuals differently regarding employment because of their sex.
- **Scope of Prohibited Practices:** Discrimination based on sex is prohibited in **all phases of the employment relationship**. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Hiring and refusing to hire.
  - Discharge or termination.
  - Compensation or pay.
  - Terms, conditions, privileges, or responsibilities of employment.
  - Promotion and transfers.
  - Training programs.
  - Discipline.
  - Job assignments.
  - Benefits.
  - Layoff.
  - Limiting, segregating, or classifying employees in any manner that may deprive them of employment opportunities or adversely affect their status because of sex.
- **Key Federal Law (Title VII):** Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is the cornerstone of anti-discrimination law in the United States, prohibiting discrimination based on sex. It generally applies to employers with **15 or more employees**. The number of employees is considered an element of a plaintiff's claim, not a jurisdictional issue. Title VII prohibits both intentional and unintentional discrimination that eliminates or restricts employment opportunities for a protected group.
- **Evolution of Sex Discrimination Law under Title VII:**
  - The prohibition on sex discrimination was added as a controversial amendment just before the bill was voted on in the House, with little legislative history to guide interpretation.
  - Initially, "because of sex" was not interpreted to include sexual orientation or gender identity by the EEOC and courts.
  - However, the EEOC reversed its position in 2015, and subsequent circuit court decisions followed.
  - In 2020, the **Supreme Court found that Title VII's protection against sex discrimination included both sexual orientation and gender identity**.
- **Oklahoma State Law (OADA):** The Oklahoma Anti-Discrimination Act (OADA) also prohibits employment practices that discriminate based on sex. The OADA applies to **all public and private employers** in Oklahoma, including those with only one employee. The Legislature stated that the **OADA provides the exclusive remedies within Oklahoma** for individuals alleging discrimination in employment based on sex, abolishing common law remedies. To file a claim under the OADA, a charge must be filed with the EEOC or state administrative agency within 180 days. Oklahoma law mirrors federal law in defining prohibited discriminatory practices.
- **Theories for Proving Discrimination:** Sex discrimination can be proven through various legal theories:
  - **Disparate Treatment:** This involves **intentional discrimination** where an employer treats individuals less favorably because of their sex. Proof of discriminatory motive is critical, though it can be inferred. This is typically proven using the three-step **burden-shifting framework** from _McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green_. The plaintiff establishes a prima facie case (member of protected class, adverse action, circumstances inferring discrimination), the employer provides a legitimate non-discriminatory reason, and the plaintiff attempts to show the reason is a pretext for discrimination. The standard for an adverse employment action now requires showing only "some" harm, not "significant harm".
  - **Disparate Impact:** This occurs when seemingly neutral policies, practices, or rules have a **disproportionate discriminatory effect** on a protected sex group, even without intent to discriminate. Statistical evidence is often used to prove this. Employers can defend by showing the practice is **job-related and consistent with business necessity**. The plaintiff can still prevail by showing an equally valid, less discriminatory alternative exists. The four-fifths (80%) rule is a common metric, but not a rigid standard.
  - **Pattern or Practice:** This theory applies when employers engage in **systemic, routine, intentional discrimination** as part of their standard operating procedures.
- **Specific Forms of Sex Discrimination:**
  - **Pregnancy Discrimination:** The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) amended Title VII to explicitly prohibit discrimination "because of or on account of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions". Women affected by pregnancy must be treated the same as others similar in their ability or inability to work. Fetal protection policies that exclude only fertile females can be discriminatory. Failure to accommodate pregnancy-related limitations can also be a basis for a claim (_Young v. UPS_). While pregnancy is distinct from disability under the ADA, some pregnancy-related conditions may qualify as disabilities.
  - **Dress and Grooming Codes:** Historically, courts often permitted different dress codes for men and women that conformed to gender stereotypes, provided they did not impose a greater burden on one sex (_Jespersen_). However, the _Bostock_ decision, which held discrimination based on gender identity is sex discrimination, has led to caution, suggesting the age of differing dress codes based solely on sex "seems to be ending," particularly if they involve treating individuals differently based on sex regardless of group comparability. Dress codes may also raise religious discrimination issues.
  - **Sexual Harassment:** Sexual harassment is considered a form of sex discrimination under Title VII. It is prohibited when it is sufficiently **severe or pervasive** to alter the conditions of employment and create an **abusive working environment**. Harassment must be based on sex or stem from discriminatory animus. It must be both objectively and subjectively offensive. Courts consider the **totality of the circumstances** when assessing severity or pervasiveness (frequency, severity, physical threat/humiliation vs. mere offense, interference with work). There are two types: **Quid Pro Quo** (tangible job action depends on sexual favors) and **Hostile Work Environment** (severe/pervasive conduct creates an abusive environment). Employer liability depends on whether the harasser is a coworker or supervisor. Having a comprehensive anti-harassment policy with accessible complaint procedures is crucial.
- **Equal Pay Act:** This federal law mandates the **same rate of pay for men and women doing substantially equal work**. Jobs must be substantially equal in skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions. Employers can defend pay disparities based on seniority, a merit system, a pay-by-quantity/quality system, or any factor other than sex.
- **Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ):** This is a **narrow exception** that permits discrimination based on sex if sex is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the business.
- **Remedies:** Remedies for sex discrimination under Title VII can include reinstatement, back pay (limited to two years prior), court costs, attorney fees, reinstatement of seniority, and injunctive relief. For cases of **intentional discrimination**, compensatory and punitive damages are also available, subject to statutory caps not revealed to the jury.
- **Retaliation:** Employees are protected from retaliation for opposing sex discrimination or filing a charge based on sex. To prove retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that **"but for"** the protected activity, the adverse action would not have occurred. Protection can extend to closely related third parties. While "after-acquired evidence" of misconduct can limit remedies like back pay, it doesn't eliminate liability for the discrimination itself.
