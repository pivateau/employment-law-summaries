# The Evolving Landscape of Worker Classification

## Introduction: The Shifting Sands of Work and the Enduring Classification Dilemma

### The Modern Workplace Transformation

- The institution of employment has undergone massive changes due to the growth of the service sector, technological advancements, and developments in the finance market.
- Traditional norms of full-time, long-term employment with set wages and predefined duties are rapidly losing status.
- Workers are increasingly engaged in non-standard forms of work, including multiple part-time jobs, work for staffing agencies, or other contingent employment, often in multiple locations and with worker-set schedules.
- The rise of the "platform economy" or "gig economy" (e.g., app-based work like Uber and Lyft) has introduced new business models that leverage digital platforms for flexible, episodic jobs. This model allows companies to scale production and handle uncertain demand, while workers may enjoy flexibility in setting hours and choosing projects.

### The Critical Importance of Worker Classification

- The distinction between an "employee" and an "independent contractor" is fundamental to employment law.
- This classification determines whether a worker is entitled to numerous crucial protections and benefits, including minimum wage, overtime pay, workers' compensation, unemployment compensation, anti-discrimination protection, and the right to organize and bargain collectively (under the NLRA in the U.S.).
- Misclassification can lead to significant lost tax revenue for governments and reduced social safety net contributions.
- For app-based workers, misclassification can result in economic and existential instability, and increased health risks due to stress and lack of protections like health insurance.

### The Inherent Challenges of Classification

- Accurately classifying workers is exceedingly difficult due to the complexity and subjectivity of tests, and the sheer variety of work arrangements.
- Existing classification tests, many rooted in older legal concepts, are often poorly suited to the nuances of app-based or "gig" work, leading to descriptions of "fitting a square peg into a round hole".
- The uncertainty and volume of lawsuits arising from worker classification issues are unsustainable, burdening workers and companies with lengthy legal processes.

## Historical Foundations and Evolving Tests of Worker Classification

### Origins in Tort Law and Vicarious Liability

- The common law distinction between employees and independent contractors originated in England in the 1800s, primarily as an agency law question concerning vicarious liability.
- The core doctrine, _respondeat superior_, held a "master" (employer) responsible for the "misconduct" or torts of their "servant" (employee) committed within the scope of employment.
- The "control test" was the original criterion to determine this relationship: the employer's right to give orders and instructions regarding the manner in which work is carried out. If the employer controlled the worker's activities, they could be held vicariously liable.

### The Shift to Statutory Protections

- In the 20th century, particularly with New Deal legislation in the U.S., worker classification became crucial for defining the scope of statutory protections (e.g., minimum wage, overtime, workers' compensation) that applied _only_ to employees.
- This introduced a new purpose for classification beyond tort liability.

### Evolution of Tests Beyond Sole Control

- The initial control test faced criticism for its "deceptive simplicity" and limitations, particularly in modern workplaces where direct oversight might be minimal, or where skilled workers retain autonomy over methods.
- This led to the development of more comprehensive approaches, such as the "total relationship" test in Canada, and the "economic realities" and "entrepreneurial opportunity" tests in the U.S., all seeking to capture the true nature of the working relationship.

## Worker Classification in the United States: A Fragmented Landscape

### The Problem of Multiplicity and Inconsistency

- The U.S. system is characterized by a "confusing array of classification tests" used at federal and state levels, which are often "complex, subjective, and differ from law to law".
- This leads to significant confusion, unpredictability, and a high volume of lawsuits.
- Contractual designations of "independent contractor" are often disregarded, as courts and agencies look to the "economic reality" of the relationship.

### Federal-Level Classification Tests

1. The Common Law Control Test:
    - While originating in tort law, versions of this test are still used by many federal statutes and agencies (e.g., ADEA, ADA, ERISA, FUTA, FICA, IRC, OSHA, Title VII, WARN) for worker classification purposes.
    - It determines if the hiring entity "controlled or had the right to control the manner and means" of the worker's work.
    - Factors considered include the extent of control by agreement, whether the worker is in a distinct occupation, the kind of occupation (supervised vs. specialist), and the skill required.
    - Despite its widespread use, it is criticized for being vague, indeterminate, and failing to provide clear guidance, often requiring fact-dependent, individual analyses.
2. The Economic Realities Test (FLSA):
    - Primarily used for the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which governs minimum wage and overtime.
    - Conceptually, a worker is an employee if, "as a matter of economic reality, the worker follows the usual path of an employee and is dependent on the business which he or she serves".
    - This test focuses on economic dependence and vulnerability, recognizing that workers lacking bargaining power require statutory protections.
    - Factors include: permanence of relationship, degree of skill, worker's investment in equipment/materials, opportunity for profit or loss depending on managerial skill, employer's control, and whether the service is an integral part of the alleged employer's business.
    - Despite its protective intent, it has been criticized as a "disembodied laundry list of factors" applied without embedding in the act's purpose, leading to unpredictable results.
3. The Entrepreneurial Opportunity Test (NLRA):
    - Used under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to determine who has the right to organize.
    - While rooted in common law agency principles, the NLRB and D.C. Circuit have emphasized "entrepreneurial opportunity" as a key consideration.
    - This approach views control and entrepreneurial opportunity as "opposite sides of the same coin".
    - It examines the "opportunities and risks inherent in entrepreneurialism," such as the ability to hire assistants, profit from their assistance, and control allocated time.
    - Critiques include a lack of clear theoretical understanding of entrepreneurship by courts, leading to reliance on "common sense notions" rather than actual entrepreneurship. Some argue it leads to "entrepreneurial potential" being emphasized over the "realities of the actual relationship".

### State-Level Classification Approaches

1. The ABC Test:
    - Gained significant traction in some states, like California (AB5), often for broad coverage (unemployment, workers' compensation, minimum wage, overtime).
    - It establishes a rebuttable presumption of employment unless all three conditions are met:
        - (A) The individual is free from control and direction over the performance of the service, both by contract and in fact.
        - (B) The service is performed outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business.
        - (C) The individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.
    - Challenges and Criticisms:
        - Rigidity: The "outside the usual course of business" (Part B) prong is particularly problematic for app-based companies whose core business _is_ the service provided by their workers (e.g., driving for a rideshare company).
        - Overly Broad Reclassification: It can force reclassification of many workers into employee status, changing business models and potentially raising consumer prices.
        - Numerous Exemptions: California's AB5, initially intended to simplify, led to 109 complex exemptions in subsequent legislation (AB2257), creating new confusion and being subject to lobbying influence rather than principled distinctions.
2. The IRS Twenty-Factor Test:
    - Adopted by some states (e.g., Arkansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Alabama, Virginia, Texas, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey).
    - Developed in 1987 (Revenue Ruling 87-41), stemming from the common law right-to-control test.
    - The 20 factors are grouped into three categories: behavioral control, financial control, and type of relationship.
    - No single factor is determinative, and the "entire relationship" is considered, with emphasis on whether "evidence of control or autonomy predominates".
    - Some find it provides more consistent results than the ABC test, allowing for factual nuances to lead to different classifications (e.g., cosmetologists in different salon models).
3. Marketplace Contractor Laws:
    - A "handful of states" (e.g., Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee, Utah, Texas) have adopted specific laws or rules for app-based workers.
    - These laws typically define "marketplace contractors" who, if they meet certain criteria, are clarified as independent contractors, rather than creating a new worker category.
    - Criticisms: These laws are criticized for precluding app-based workers from employment-related protections (like workers' compensation) and for being self-serving to companies seeking to avoid costs and risks associated with employees.

### The "Gig Economy" and the Push for a Third Category

- App-based companies have actively lobbied for laws that accommodate their business model and preserve independent contractor status for workers, leading to legal challenges and the creation of ballot initiatives.
- Proposition 22 (California): This initiative, passed by voters, created a _de facto_ "third category" of worker for app-based drivers.
  - It provides _some_ benefits (e.g., minimum hourly wage calculated differently from employees, health care stipends) but "lowers the baseline employment standards" compared to full employee status.
  - It has been criticized for potentially exacerbating racial inequalities, as a high percentage of gig workers are immigrants and subordinated minorities.
- The creation of a "third category" of worker that lies between independent contractors and employees has been proposed by many.
