# Disability Discrimination and Employer's Duty to Accommodate

Disability discrimination laws aim to ensure equal employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. This area of law has evolved significantly, particularly with the advent of federal statutes that prohibit discrimination and mandate accommodations.

## History and Development of Disability Discrimination Law

The foundation of federal disability discrimination law can be traced to the **Rehabilitation Act of 1973**, which preceded the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and applied to federal contractors and grant recipients.

The **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990** significantly expanded federal protections, marking one of the most important civil rights bills since the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title I of the ADA prohibits private employers, state and local governments, employment agencies, and labor unions from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities in all aspects of employment, including hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, and training. The ADA initially covered employers with 25 or more employees, a threshold later lowered to 15, matching the coverage of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Rehabilitation Act essentially mirrors the ADA with regard to employee protections and prohibited employer conduct.

In response to narrow judicial interpretations of "disability" and "substantially limits," Congress passed the **Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA)**. This amendment aimed to broaden the class of workers protected by the ADA and to make it easier to conclude that individuals with a wide range of impairments, such as cancer, diabetes, epilepsy, and intellectual disabilities, are covered. The **Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)** consistently issues guidance emphasizing this broader coverage and provides resources for employers regarding medical information and reasonable accommodations.

Oklahoma also has its own law, the **Oklahoma Anti-Discrimination Act (OADA)**, which prohibits discrimination based on disability and largely mirrors federal provisions, including the requirement for reasonable accommodation unless it imposes an undue business hardship.

## Key Definitions Under the ADA

- **Qualified Individual with a Disability**: This refers to a disabled individual who can perform the essential functions of a job with or without "reasonable accommodations".

- **Disabled Individual**: The ADA defines a disabled individual as a person who:

1. Has a **physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities**;
2. Has a **record of such an impairment**; or
3. Is **regarded as having such an impairment**.

- **Substantially Limits**: This term is to be **construed broadly** in favor of expansive coverage and is not meant to be a demanding standard. It means the impairment limits the ability to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population, not necessarily preventing or severely restricting it. An individualized assessment is required, but the threshold issue should not demand extensive analysis.

- **Major Life Activities**: These include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and **working**. It also includes the operation of major bodily functions such as those of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions. The EEOC considers basic obesity, even without an underlying condition, to sufficiently impact life activities to qualify as a disability or perceived disability.

- **Direct Threat Exception**: The ADA provides an exception if an individual's disability poses a "direct threat". A **"direct threat" is defined as a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation**. Factors considered include the duration of the risk, nature and severity of potential harm, likelihood of occurrence, and imminence of the harm.

- **Association Discrimination**: The ADA also prohibits discrimination based on an employer's association or relationship with an individual who has a known disability.

- **Pre-employment Inquiries**: Employers are generally prohibited from making inquiries about the existence, nature, or severity of disabilities at the pre-offer stage. However, they may ask about an applicant's ability to perform essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation.

- **Testing**: A test for illegal drug use is _not_ considered a medical examination under the ADA and can be given pre-offer. However, **alcohol testing** **is** **considered a medical examination** and can only be conducted post-offer. Information from drug and alcohol testing about prescription drug use must be kept confidential.

- **HIV/AIDS**: The ADA prohibits discrimination based on HIV-positive status or AIDS diagnosis and restricts testing to post-job offer, applied universally to all in the position. Medical information, including HIV status, must be kept confidential.

- **Pregnancy**: While pregnancy itself is generally not considered a disability under the ADA, pregnancy-related impairments _can_ qualify as disabilities if they substantially limit major life activities. The **Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA)**, effective June 27, 2023, requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The EEOC's final rule implementing PWFA provides examples of accommodations (e.g., additional breaks, a stool, time off for appointments, temporary reassignment). Employers are encouraged to communicate early and frequently with workers and should only seek supporting documentation when reasonable. State laws may offer even broader protections.

## Employer's Duty to Accommodate

The requirement for employers to make "reasonable accommodations" for disabled employees or applicants is often considered the most challenging duty under the ADA.

- **Defining Reasonable Accommodation**: A reasonable accommodation is broadly defined as **"any change in the work environment or in the way things are customarily done that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities"**. This can include:
	- Job restructuring.
	- Modification of work schedules, including allowing part-time employment.
	- Job reassignments.
	- Acquisition of devices to help accommodate an individual with a disability.
	- Use of interpreters or other support personnel.

**Work from home** is increasingly recognized as a reasonable accommodation in many situations.

- **Interactive Process**: Employers and employees **must engage in an interactive process** to determine appropriate accommodations. This involves open communication to understand the employee's needs and explore potential solutions. Failure to engage in this process can make it difficult for an employer to defend against a claim of failing to provide a reasonable accommodation. Similarly, the employee has a duty to cooperate by providing input and necessary documentation.

### What is Not Required

◦ Employers are **not required to create new positions** that do not already exist.

- They are **not required to eliminate essential functions** of a job to accommodate a disabled individual, though changing nonessential functions is considered reasonable.
- The ADA generally **does not require an employer to assign a disabled employee to a particular job if another employee is entitled to that position according to an established seniority system**. However, simply providing a "preference" (e.g., violating a rule others must obey) does not automatically make an accommodation unreasonable.
   ◦ The law **does not require employers to accommodate an employee’s religious practices in a way that spares the employee any cost whatsoever**.
   ◦ The ADA also **does not require employers to overlook past misconduct** that resulted from an employee's disability.

- **Undue Hardship**: An employer is excused from providing an accommodation if it can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an **"undue hardship"** on the operation of the business. Undue hardship arises when the proposed modification requires **"significant difficulty or expense in relation to the size of the business, its available resources, and the nature of its operations"**. Factors considered include the nature and cost of the accommodation, and the size, type, and financial resources of the employer and the place of employment.

**Distinction from Religious Accommodation**: It is important to note that the standard for "undue hardship" under the ADA differs from the standard for religious accommodations. For religious accommodations, the U.S. Supreme Court, in _Groff v. DeJoy_ (2023), clarified that an employer must demonstrate the "burden of granting an accommodation would result in **substantial increased costs** in relation to the conduct of its particular business," moving away from the previous "de minimis" cost standard. This "substantial increased cost" standard applies to religious accommodations, while for **ADA disability accommodations, the "significant difficulty or expense" standard** remains.

### Leave as an Accommodation:

- Employers may be required to provide leave as a reasonable accommodation, even if no leave benefit is offered, the employee is ineligible, or all other leave (e.g., FMLA, workers' compensation) has been exhausted.
- However, the ADA **does not require paid leave as a reasonable accommodation**.
- Employers should not use rigid maximum leave policies or require employees to be restriction-free to return to work, as this may violate the ADA. The interactive process should continue even if an employee is on extended leave.

- **Resources**: The federally funded **Job Accommodation Network (JAN)** provides free assistance and resources to employers and employees on reasonable accommodations. The EEOC also publishes extensive guidance documents on various aspects of disability accommodation.

## Proving a Disability Discrimination Claim

To prove a claim of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff generally must show:

1. Membership in the **protected class** (i.e., being a qualified individual with a disability).

2. The employer took an **adverse employment action**.

3. The individual was **performing satisfactorily** at the time of the action.

4. The circumstances surrounding the employer's action **indicate discrimination**.

Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the **burden shifts to the employer** to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. The plaintiff may then attempt to prove that the employer's stated reason is a **pretext** for discrimination, and that disability was a determining factor.

For a **failure to accommodate claim**, specifically, the plaintiff must show:

1. The plaintiff is **disabled**.

2. The plaintiff is **otherwise qualified for the job**.

3. The plaintiff **requested a plausibly or facially reasonable accommodation**.

A notable point is that a person claiming to be totally disabled for Social Security or other purposes may still be a "qualified individual with a disability" under the ADA, as the standards differ. However, statements made during Social Security applications can be used to challenge an individual's qualification for a job. Employers are generally not liable if they were unaware of the employee's disability when the adverse employment action was taken.
