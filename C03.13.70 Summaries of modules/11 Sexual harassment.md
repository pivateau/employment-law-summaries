# Sexual harassment

The key legal principles underlying the law of sexual harassment in employment are:

1. **Sexual Harassment as a Form of Sex Discrimination:** Sexual harassment is considered a form of sexual discrimination prohibited under **Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964**. While Title VII's text does not explicitly mention harassment, the U.S. Supreme Court defined it as a form of discrimination in _Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson_. The rules established for sexual harassment in _Meritor_ apply to harassment based on other protected categories under Title VII.
2. **Governing Law:** The primary federal law is Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC enforces laws including Title VII and cases involving workplace retaliation and sexual harassment.
3. **Scope of Protection:** Discrimination in employment based on sex is prohibited in all phases of the employment relationship, including terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. Harassment is prohibited because it can alter the terms or conditions of employment.
4. **Definition:** Sexual harassment involves **"unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature"** under specific circumstances. To violate Title VII, the conduct must be **"because of sex"** or other protected classifications, not just general workplace harassment.
5. **Types of Sexual Harassment:** The law recognizes two main types of sexual harassment:
    - **Quid Pro Quo:** This occurs when **"submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment"** or when **"submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual"**. It involves employer conduct that takes a tangible job action in reaction to sexually harassing conduct. This often involves a supervisor demanding sexual favors and the employee's rejection leading to job detriment. The unwelcome nature of the behavior is key, and voluntary acceptance of demands does not invalidate a claim.
    - **Hostile Work Environment:** This arises when **"such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment"**. It must be based on the plaintiff's sex, color, or national origin or stem from discriminatory animus.
6. **Standard for Hostile Work Environment:** To be actionable, the harassment must be **"sufficiently severe or pervasive"** that it alters the terms or conditions of employment and creates an **abusive working environment**. It is not a civility code, and courts must consider the context.

    - **Objective and Subjective Offense:** The environment must be both **objectively and subjectively offensive**; a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive, and the victim must actually perceive it to be so.
    - **Totality of the Circumstances:** Courts consider **all the circumstances**, including the **frequency** of the conduct, its **severity**, whether it is **physically threatening or humiliating or merely offensive**, and whether it **unreasonably interferes with work performance**. The level of severity or pervasiveness required is high.
    - Conduct is judged by looking at the **workplace conduct as a whole**, not in isolation.
7. **Employer Liability:** Employer liability for harassment is nuanced.

    - **Strict Liability:** Employers are generally **strictly liable** for the acts of a **supervisor** if the supervisor takes a **tangible adverse employment action**, such as termination or demotion. A supervisor is someone empowered to take tangible employment actions (hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, discipline).
    - **Affirmative Defense (Faragher Defense):** If **no tangible job action results** from the harassment by a supervisor, the employer can escape liability by establishing an affirmative defense. This defense requires the employer to prove (a) that they took **reasonable measures to prevent or correct** the harassment, and (b) that the complainant employee **failed to take advantage** of those measures.
    - The possibility of vicarious liability depends on whether the alleged harasser is a coworker or supervisor. The employer may be liable for supervisor harassment even if they didn't know about it, provided no tangible action occurred and the affirmative defense is not proven.
8. **EEOC Guidance on Prevention:** The EEOC recommends employers maintain a comprehensive and effective **anti-harassment policy**, an effective and accessible **harassment complaint system**, and effective **harassment training** for all employees and managers. These measures are crucial for preventing harassment and can be part of the employer's affirmative defense. The EEOC provides detailed recommendations for these components.
