# Religious discrimination

Religious discrimination in employment is broadly prohibited by both federal and state laws, most notably Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and in Oklahoma, by the Oklahoma Anti-Discrimination Act (OADA).

Here's a breakdown of religious discrimination, focusing on accommodation and undue hardship:

## Religious Discrimination Overview

Title VII protects **sincerely held religious beliefs and practices**. The term "religion" is defined broadly, encompassing established, formal religions, new ones, and those followed by only a few individuals, including all aspects of religious observance, practice, and belief. Employers typically **should not question the sincerity of an employee's religious beliefs** and should assume requests for religious accommodation are legitimate, unless there is strong evidence to the contrary. Political and social views are generally not considered religious beliefs.

Employers are prohibited from discriminating against individuals based on their religion in all aspects of employment, including compensation, hiring, promotion, transfers, training, discipline, and termination. Additionally, Title VII allows for claims of **racial harassment based on a hostile work environment**, which applies when a workplace is "permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult" severe enough to "alter the conditions of the victimâ€™s employment and create an abusive working environment". This principle extends to national origin discrimination and religious harassment.

**Exemptions:**

- **Religious Organizations Exemption:** Section 702 of Title VII exempts religious organizations from the prohibition against religious discrimination, allowing them to prefer members of their own faith in employment decisions. Courts consider various factors to determine if an entity is "primarily religious," such as its purpose, activities, affiliations, and whether it holds itself out as secular or sectarian. However, this exemption **does not permit religious organizations to discriminate on other protected bases** like race, sex, or age.
- **Ministerial Exception:** This exception, stemming from both Title VII and the First Amendment, **prohibits clergy members from bringing claims for alleged violations of federal anti-discrimination laws** against religious organizations. The Supreme Court has clarified that the "essential factor is 'what an employee does'," not merely their job title or formal religious training, when determining if this exception applies.
- **Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ):** Religion can also serve as a BFOQ, allowing discrimination if it is "reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise". Courts interpret the BFOQ defense very narrowly. For example, a university was allowed to insist on hiring only Jesuit candidates for philosophy professors to maintain its religious identity.

### Theory of Accommodation

Title VII requires employers to **reasonably accommodate an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship** on the conduct of the employer's business. This means allowing the individual to engage in a religious practice despite the employer's normal rules.

To establish a **prima facie case for failure to accommodate**, an employee typically needs to show:

1. They have a **bona fide religious belief** that conflicts with a job requirement.
2. They **informed the employer of this conflict**.
3. The employer **fired them for failing to comply** with the job requirement, or took another adverse action.

An employer with actual knowledge of a need for religious accommodation violates Title VII if their motive is to avoid accommodation, even if they only have an unsubstantiated suspicion that accommodation would be needed. The employee also has a duty to cooperate with the employer's attempts to accommodate.

### Undue Hardship Defense

The employer must prove that it cannot offer a reasonable accommodation without **undue hardship**. For nearly 50 years, "undue hardship" in religious accommodation was defined as anything more than a "de minimis" (minimal) cost.

However, the U.S. Supreme Court "clarified" this standard in **June 2023**:

- **New Standard:** An employer seeking to deny religious accommodation must now demonstrate that "the **burden of granting an accommodation would result in substantial increased costs in relation to the conduct of its particular business**". This replaces the "de minimis" cost standard.
- **Impact on Coworkers:** While impacts on coworkers previously held more significance, the new standard requires employers to demonstrate how any impact on other employees **directly relates to the "conduct of [its] business" and constitutes a "substantial increased cost"**. This imposes a more rigorous burden on employers.
- **Reasonableness:** A reasonable accommodation does not require a total accommodation or sparing the employee any cost whatsoever. The employer is not obligated to provide the employee's preferred accommodation. What constitutes reasonable is a fact-specific determination made on a case-by-case basis.

### Latest Accommodation Cases

1. **_Groff v. DeJoy_ (2023)**: This landmark Supreme Court case directly addressed the "undue hardship" standard for religious accommodation under Title VII. The Court moved away from the "de minimis" cost standard, requiring employers to show **"substantial increased costs"** to deny an accommodation. The decision's impact on seniority-based bidding systems is not yet fully clear, but employers should not assume their seniority system alone protects them, and should analyze the specific facts and bidding system when evaluating religious accommodation requests. This new standard is expected to make it harder for employers to deny religious accommodation requests, especially for larger employers who may have more available talent to perform other tasks and can better afford accommodation costs.
2. **_Gunkel v. OU Medicine, Inc._ (2024)**: This federal district court case in Oklahoma involved a plaintiff claiming religious discrimination after being terminated for refusing a COVID-19 vaccine mandate based on "philosophical or religious beliefs". The court dismissed the claim because the plaintiff **failed to provide enough detailed information about his sincere religious beliefs** for the employer to consider or potentially accommodate them, thus making it impossible to infer discrimination. This case highlights the employee's burden in articulating their religious beliefs.
3. **_EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch_ (2015)**: The Supreme Court held that an employer **cannot refuse to hire an applicant based on a desire to avoid accommodating a religious practice**, even if the employer only suspects an accommodation would be needed and does not have concrete knowledge of the need for accommodation. This case involved a Muslim applicant who wore a hijab, which conflicted with the employer's "Look Policy".
4. **Dress Codes and Religious Accommodation (e.g., _Cloutier v. Costco Wholesale Co._ (2004) and _Camara v. Epps Air Serv._ (2017))**: These cases illustrate that employers may need to accommodate individuals whose religious requirements necessitate clothing that would otherwise violate a dress code. While reasonable dress codes grounded in safety, efficiency, or business concerns may be upheld, employers must **reasonably accommodate religious beliefs and practices unless doing so would impose an undue hardship**.

In summary, the landscape of religious discrimination law emphasizes an employer's duty to reasonably accommodate religious practices, with the burden to prove "undue hardship" now set at a "substantial increased costs" level following the _Groff_ decision. Both employers and employees have responsibilities in the interactive process of finding suitable accommodations.
