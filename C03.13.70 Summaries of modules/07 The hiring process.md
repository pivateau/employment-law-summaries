# The hiring process

The hiring process is a critical series of steps for any business, designed to maximize productivity, reduce risks, and promote growth by selecting the most suitable employees. It involves navigating various legal requirements, particularly those aimed at avoiding wrongful discrimination. The hiring process generally consists of three main stages: **recruitment, information gathering, and selection**.

## Recruitment

The first stage of the hiring process involves efforts to attract potential candidates for open positions. A key goal during recruitment is to ensure a **broad applicant pool**, which signals that the employer does not intend to restrict applications based on protected characteristics.

Before gathering applications, an employer should **create a written job description** that details the essential functions and duties, both fundamental and occasional, of the position. This is especially important for employers subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as "essential functions" are fundamental to the role. Evidence of essential functions can include the employer's judgment, written job descriptions, time spent on the function, and consequences of not performing it. Additionally, employers must determine and list **job qualifications** such as education, skills, experience, and licenses, ensuring a legitimate connection between the qualification and the job to avoid the appearance of discrimination.

Recruitment methods include:

- **Advertisements:** Employers commonly advertise job openings through the internet, newspapers, magazines, and trade journals. Advertisements **must not indicate any preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination based on protected categories** (e.g., sex, age, race), unless a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) is involved. The focus should be on job requirements, not the type of person needed. Employers should also use sex-neutral job titles (e.g., "server" instead of "waitress" or "waiter") and avoid language implying youth (e.g., "recent college graduate"). It is a strategic point to include a statement that the business is "**An Equal Employment Opportunity Employer**" in all recruitment processes. Information about positions should be available in different media to accommodate individuals with various disabilities.
- **Word-of-Mouth Recruiting:** While not inherently discriminatory, reliance solely on this method may violate Title VII if the existing workforce lacks diversity compared to the relevant labor market, as it could **perpetuate existing demographic imbalances**.
- **Nepotism:** Policies encouraging the recruiting of relatives are not barred by Title VII, but similar to word-of-mouth recruiting, they can lead to discrimination claims if they perpetuate existing workforce characteristics and adversely impact protected classes. Employers should actively recruit members of adversely affected protected classes to avoid such claims.
- **Promoting from Within:** Exclusive reliance on internal promotions can also lead to a **disparate impact challenge** if the current workforce is not diverse.
- **Recruiting Agents:** Employers using third-party recruiters (e.g., private employment agencies) can be held **liable for their discriminatory recruiting and referral practices** under agency principles. Employers should inform agents of their obligation to comply with ADA and other nondiscrimination requirements.
- **Walk-in Applications:** Accepting "walk-in" applications can raise Title VII liability if there's a substantial disparity between the employer's workforce and the labor market. Employers are not required to accept all unsolicited applications but must administer their policy in a non-discriminatory manner.
- **Internet Recruitment:** The internet significantly expands the applicant pool but raises legal concerns, particularly regarding when an individual becomes an "applicant." For government contractors, an "Internet Applicant" must submit an expression of interest online, be considered for a particular position, possess basic qualifications, and not withdraw from consideration.
- **Using Social Media:** Employers using social media for recruitment or research can unwittingly violate anti-discrimination laws. Targeted advertising on social media, for example, may exclude older workers and face legal challenges under the ADEA.

## Information Gathering

This stage involves collecting information to screen applicants. Even common employment applications act as screening devices, and their use is governed by **disparate impact theory**. If a screening device yields a disproportionate result on a protected class, the employer can be liable, even without discriminatory intent.

Employers should exercise caution with pre-employment inquiries:

- **Direct Inquiries Regarding Protected Class Status:** Employers should eliminate all pre-employment inquiries eliciting protected class information unless for affirmative action or EEO reporting, in which case data should be collected on a separate, voluntary, and confidential form.
- **Age:** While inquiring about age or date of birth isn't strictly illegal, it can lead to scrutiny. Questions that are proxies for age, like high school graduation dates, should be avoided. Employers can ask if an applicant is over 18 for minor employment laws.
- **Citizenship, Place of Birth, or National Origin:** The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) prohibits hiring unauthorized aliens but also discrimination based on citizenship or immigration status. Employers should ask if applicants are authorized to work in the U.S. and require documentation _after_ hiring, avoiding questions about national origin or place of birth.
- **Familial Status:** Some states prohibit discrimination based on marital status. Inquiries about pregnancy, child-bearing, or children can lead to claims of **sex-plus discrimination** or **disparate impact** against women. Such information should be collected only after employment for tax or insurance purposes, on a separate form.
- **Financial Status:** Requiring a good credit record may have a **disproportionate impact on minority groups**. Federal EEO laws prohibit using financial information if it doesn't accurately identify responsible employees and significantly disadvantages a protected group. Inquiries about personal assets, liabilities, or credit ratings should be job-related.
- **Height and Weight:** These requirements often constitute a **disparate impact** violation, disproportionately affecting women and certain ethnic groups, and may conflict with disability laws. Such information should not be collected before a conditional employment offer.
- **Physical and Mental Condition:** The ADA prohibits pre-offer inquiries into the existence, nature, or severity of disabilities. Employers can inquire about the applicant's ability to perform **essential job functions** with or without reasonable accommodation, but not in terms of disability. Guidance recommends avoiding questions about mental illness history.
- **Photograph Requests:** Employers should not require photographs or physical descriptions from job applicants before a hiring decision is made.
- **Weekend or Holiday Work Availability:** Employers should ask about availability directly, not about religious observances, to avoid religious discrimination claims. Reasonable accommodation for religious needs is required unless it causes undue hardship.
- **Military Experience:** Inquiries about military discharge type may have a **disproportionate impact** on minority applicants and should be job-related and evaluated case-by-case.
- **Education, Skills, and Work Experience:** If these requirements have a **disparate impact** on a protected class, the employer must prove **business necessity** and a substantial relationship to the job. Periodic reviews and empirical validation are recommended.
- **Social Media Activity:** Many states prohibit employers from requiring social media passwords. Employers should be cautious, as reviewing profiles before an interview can reveal protected class information.
- **"Ban the Box" Initiatives:** These initiatives delay inquiries about conviction history until later in the hiring process, aiming to increase fairness for applicants with criminal records. Because Black and Latino men are arrested and convicted at disproportionately higher rates, asking about criminal records upfront has a **disproportionate impact**. Federal "Ban the Box" laws apply to federal employers and contractors. Oklahoma's version applies to public employers, allowing criminal history questions during interviews but not on initial applications. Employers should respect EEOC guidance, which suggests individualized assessment considering the nature and gravity of the offense, time passed, and job sought. Inquiries about arrests should be avoided, focusing instead on convictions or guilty pleas if business necessity requires it.

Employers should generally limit pre-employment inquiries to those directly related to safe and efficient job performance. An **"equal employment opportunity" statement** should be included on application forms. A **disclaimer** regarding at-will employment can also be useful to counter claims of implied contracts.

**Interviews** are a key part of information gathering. Interviewers should be trained to ask only appropriate, business-related questions and to avoid questions concerning health and disability. Employers should prepare written interview questions and ask each applicant the same basic set of questions to avoid discriminatory lines of questioning. Interview notes can be used as evidence in discrimination cases, so references to protected categories should be avoided. Social media profiles should generally not be reviewed _before_ an interview.

## Selection

At this stage, the employer determines if an applicant can satisfy the job's requirements, often utilizing **tests**. While testing can help identify good employees, it carries legal risks.

### Testing in Selection

Workplace testing broadly falls into two categories: **eligibility testing** and **ineligibility testing**.

**Eligibility Testing** Eligibility tests assess a potential employee's skills and qualifications to perform job requirements or to identify the most capable applicants.

- **Disparate Impact:** Eligibility tests may have a **disparate impact** on protected classes. To be exempt from such claims, a test must be **professionally developed, job-related, and consistent with business necessity**.
- **Types of Cognitive Ability Tests:** These measure mental abilities and cognitive functions to predict job performance. Examples include:
  - **Verbal Comprehension and Reasoning Tests:** Assess ability to process and interpret written information.
  - **Numerical Reasoning and Ability Tests:** Focus on interpreting and analyzing numbers.
  - **Learning Agility Tests:** Assess how quickly someone can understand and master new concepts.
  - **Perception Tests:** Measure speed and accuracy in gathering and retaining information.
  - **Logical Reasoning Tests:** Require candidates to apply logic to scenarios based on provided information.
- **Integrity Tests:** Used to assess personality, honesty, and propensity to steal. Employers must keep information obtained from these tests confidential and obtain appropriate releases. A significant risk arises if an integrity test is found to constitute an **illegal medical exam** under the ADA, which can only be required after a conditional job offer.
- **Physical or Skills Tests:** Often given for physically demanding jobs, these tests must be **related to an essential function of the job**. Job simulations, which involve components that are examples of normal job activity, are a common approach.
- **Validation:** If a test has a **disparate impact**, the employer must show it is **"job-related" and justified by "business necessity"**. The **Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures** outline three methods for validating employment tests:
  - **Criterion-Related Validation:** Shows a correlation between test scores and job performance.
  - **Content Validation:** Demonstrates that the test content represents a substantial portion of the actual job, often based on job analysis.
  - **Construct Validation:** Measures identifiable characteristics (e.g., leadership) important for job performance, requiring careful job analysis.
  - The **"four-fifths (or 80%) rule"** is an informal guide used by the EEOC to assess disparate impact, where a selection rate for any group less than 80% of the highest selection rate for another group may indicate disparate impact.

**Ineligibility Testing** Ineligibility tests identify traits that would prevent an employee from performing job duties, such as drug or alcohol addictions.

- **Pre-Employment Physical Medical Examinations:** These can ensure fitness, detect communicable diseases, and establish a medical baseline. Under the ADA, such exams can only be required **after a conditional offer of employment** and must be given to all entering employees in the same job category. Results must be kept confidential. If an offer is withdrawn based on medical information, the employer must show the criteria are **job-related and consistent with business necessity**, and the individual cannot perform essential functions even with reasonable accommodation.
- **Drug and Alcohol Testing:**
  - **Illegal Drug Use Tests:** Not considered a medical examination under the ADA, so they can be given _prior_ to a job offer.
  - **Alcohol Testing:** Is considered a medical examination under the ADA and can only be conducted on a **post-offer basis**.
  - Information revealed by these tests, particularly prescription drug use, is subject to ADA confidentiality requirements. Oklahoma law permits drug and alcohol testing for applicants and employees under specific conditions, including pre-employment, reasonable suspicion, and post-accident. Oklahoma also has rules against direct observation during urine sample collection and requires confirmation of positive tests.
- **Polygraph Tests:** The **Employee Polygraph Protection Act (EPPA)** generally **prohibits most private employers from using lie detector tests** for pre-employment screening or during employment. Exceptions exist for security service firms and pharmaceutical companies, and for employees reasonably suspected of workplace incidents resulting in economic loss. Strict standards for test conduct and disclosure apply where tests are permitted. Oklahoma law also has a "Polygraph Bill of Rights" that ensures voluntariness and specific examinee rights, being more restrictive than federal law in some areas.
- **Genetic Tests:** The **Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA)** prohibits employers from discriminating based on genetic information and generally prevents requesting or requiring genetic information from individuals or their family members, with rare exceptions. Information obtained must be kept strictly confidential. Employers can use a "safe harbor" warning to third parties providing medical information to avoid inadvertent acquisition of genetic information. Oklahoma has its own version, the **Genetic Nondiscrimination in Employment Act**, which similarly prohibits employers from seeking or using genetic tests or information to discriminate.
- **Credit Investigations:** The **Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)** limits employers' use of commercial reporting agencies for evaluating applicants. Employers must provide **written notice and obtain permission** from applicants/employees before obtaining a consumer report. If an adverse employment action is taken based on a report, the applicant/employee must receive a copy of the report and their rights. The EEOC views credit requirements as potentially having a **disparate impact on minority groups** and can file lawsuits if such requirements are not job-related and justified by business necessity. Many states also limit the use of credit information in employment.
- **Arrest and Conviction Records:** Employers' use of criminal records can have an **adverse impact on ex-offenders**, particularly minority groups, due to disproportionate arrest and conviction rates. The **EEOC Guidance** recommends against broad use of criminal histories and encourages an **individualized assessment** that considers the nature and gravity of the offense, the time passed, and the nature of the job. The "ban the box" movement encourages delaying criminal history inquiries until later in the hiring process to allow employers to first assess job readiness. While Oklahoma law for private employers doesn't prohibit discriminating based on unsealed criminal records, employers should still utilize the EEOC Guidance. Employers must also comply with the FCRA when using third parties for background checks, including notification and consent requirements. Oklahoma law explicitly bars employers from inquiring about **sealed criminal records**.

Throughout the selection process, and indeed the entire hiring process, employers must remain vigilant to ensure their practices are non-discriminatory and legally compliant, balancing their business needs with the protected rights of applicants and employees.
