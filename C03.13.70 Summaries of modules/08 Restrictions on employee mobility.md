# Restrictions on employee mobility

Employers often implement various measures to restrict employee mobility, primarily to safeguard their legitimate business interests, such as protecting confidential information, trade secrets, and customer relationships. These restrictions generally include noncompetition agreements, confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements, and protections afforded by trade secret law and the common law duty of loyalty.

## Noncompetition Agreements

A **noncompetition agreement**, also known as a "covenant not to compete" or "restrictive covenant," is a contractual promise that limits an employee's ability, upon leaving employment, to engage in the same type of business for a stated time in the same market as the former employer. The primary purpose of these agreements is not to punish the former employee, but to **protect the employer from unfair competition**, including its customer base, trade secrets, and other vital information, and to encourage employers to invest in their employees. Noncompetition agreements can also deter employee movement and make it more difficult for competitors to poach key employees, reducing the risk of lawsuits for tortious interference with contracts.

**Oklahoma Law on Noncompetition Agreements:** Oklahoma has a strong public policy against noncompetition agreements in the employment context. Oklahoma law, specifically **Okla. Stat. tit. 15, §§ 217–219**, explicitly states that "Every contract by which any one is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind, otherwise than as provided by Sections 218 and 219 of this title, . . . is to that extent void". This statutory ban predates Oklahoma's statehood, first enacted in 1908, and remains largely enduring, reflecting the state's motto, "Labor Conquers All Things".

The **judicial interpretation of this ban in Oklahoma has fluctuated** over time.

- Initially, courts rigidly prohibited nearly all such agreements.
- However, in 1970, _Tatum v. Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Co._, the Oklahoma Supreme Court began to modify this rigid stance, enforcing an agreement that only prevented a departing salesman from selling _to his former employer's customers_ for two years, rather than broadly restraining his profession.
- Further easing occurred in 1977 with _Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma v. National Collegiate Athletic Association_, where the court applied a **common-law reasonableness analysis**, suggesting that only _unreasonable_ restraints on trade were void. This "reasonableness" was determined by factors such as whether the restraint was "no greater than is required for the employer’s protection from unfair competition," did "not impose undue hardship on the employee," and was "not injurious to the public".
- Despite this period of flexibility, the Oklahoma Supreme Court returned to its previous strict position in **2011 with _Howard v. Nitro-Lift Technologies, L.L.C._**. The Court refused to enforce a broad noncompetition agreement, emphasizing the "plain, clear, unmistakable, unambiguous, and unequivocal language of Okla. Stat. tit. 15 § 219A (2001) prohibits employers from binding employees to agreements which bar their ability to find gainful employment in the same business or industry as that of the employer". The court noted that the agreement "conceivably could be interpreted to prevent the employees from taking jobs in any capacity from a competing business".
- This strict interpretation was reinforced by the Fifth Circuit in _Cardoni v. Prosperity Bank_, which determined that Oklahoma had a "clear policy against enforcement of most noncompetition agreements" and that applying Texas law (which is more permissive) would "contravene Oklahoma’s statutory aversion".

**Nonsolicitation Agreements as a Limited Exception:** In 2001, the Oklahoma legislature amended its noncompetition law to create a specific exception for **nonsolicitation agreements**. Under Title 15 O.S. § 219A, an employee may engage in the same or similar business as a former employer, provided they "do not directly solicit the sale of goods, services or a combination of goods and services from the established customers of the former employer". Any contract provision conflicting with these terms is "void and unenforceable".

**Federal Regulation of Noncompete Agreements:** On January 5, 2023, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) proposed a new rule to **ban most non-compete agreements** between employers and workers, aiming to protect workers' freedom to change jobs, ensure marketplace competition, and facilitate new business creation. The final rule was published on May 7, 2024, with an effective date of September 4, 2024. However, a federal court in Texas issued a nationwide injunction on August 20, 2024, preventing this rule from taking effect, leaving the legal landscape uncertain. Despite the injunction, the FTC can still investigate and take case-by-case enforcement actions against noncompetes that harm competition.

## Other Means of Restricting Employee Mobility

Beyond noncompete agreements, employers use other legal mechanisms to protect their interests and, by extension, restrict certain types of employee mobility.

**1. Trade Secret Law:** Oklahoma has adopted the **Uniform Trade Secrets Act (OUTSA)**, which provides a framework for protecting valuable confidential information.

- A **trade secret** is defined as information that derives economic value from not being generally known and is subject to "efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy". This can include confidential operating and pricing policies.
- Oklahoma courts use a **six-factor test** to determine if information qualifies as a trade secret, considering factors like how widely the information is known outside and inside the business, measures taken to guard its secrecy, its value to the business and competitors, and the effort/money expended in its development.
- The OUTSA provides causes of action for **misappropriation**, defined as improper acquisition or unauthorized disclosure of a trade secret. To prove misappropriation, a plaintiff must show "(i) the existence of a trade secret: (ii) misappropriation of the secrets by Defendant; and (iii) use of the secrets by Defendant to the Plaintiff’s detriment".
- Remedies include **injunctive relief** (to prevent actual or threatened misappropriation) and **monetary damages**. The OUTSA generally displaces other causes of action for misappropriation, but it does exempt other remedies not based on misappropriation, including contractual claims like breach of non-compete, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of loyalty.

**2. Confidentiality Agreements (Nondisclosure Agreements):** These agreements are designed to prevent a former employee from using or disclosing confidential information obtained during employment. The sources indicate that **nondisclosure agreements "resemble noncompetition agreements, with the same restrictions on enforceability"** and are subjected to "the same sort of balancing tests" by courts. While the law does not intend them to punish the former employee, they aim to protect an employer's confidential information. It is considered a best practice for employers to have employees sign **written agreements specifically prohibiting the disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information**, with a careful definition of what information is considered confidential.

**3. Common Law Duty of Loyalty:** Even in the absence of a written agreement, employees typically have a common law duty to their employers. This duty, while not explicitly detailed in the provided sources as a direct _restriction on mobility_ in the same way as non-competes, is implied as a protection for employers. The sources state that "Even without a written agreement, **employees must keep confidential information they know or should have known the employer desires to keep secret**". Furthermore, the sources list "disclosing trade secrets to a competitor" and "working for a competitor" as forms of "disloyalty". The concept of "breach of fiduciary duty" and "breach of loyalty" are also mentioned as contractual remedies that are _not_ displaced by the Oklahoma Uniform Trade Secrets Act, suggesting they are recognized legal claims that can arise from an employee's actions.

**4. Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine:**
The "inevitable disclosure" doctrine is a legal principle that allows an employer to prevent a former employee from working for a competitor, even in the absence of a non-compete agreement, if it can be shown that the employee's new role will **inevitably lead to the disclosure or use of the former employer's trade secrets**.

In essence, it's a way for companies to protect their valuable confidential information when an employee, due to the nature of their knowledge and the similarity of their new role, would find it impossible to perform their new job without relying on or inadvertently disclosing their former employer's trade secrets.

**How it can be used in situations where there is no noncompete agreement:**

The inevitable disclosure doctrine is particularly relevant in situations where a former employee did not sign a non-compete agreement, or where such an agreement is deemed unenforceable. It operates under the premise that even without an explicit contractual restriction, an employee has a common law and/or statutory duty to protect their former employer's trade secrets.

Here's how it generally works and key factors courts consider:

1. **Trade Secret Existence:** The former employer must first prove that the information in question qualifies as a trade secret. This generally means the information:
    - Derives independent economic value from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.
    - Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.

2. **Threatened Misappropriation:** The employer must show that the former employee's new employment poses a "threatened misappropriation" of these trade secrets. This is where "inevitable disclosure" comes in. Instead of proving actual theft or disclosure, the employer argues that disclosure is highly probable or unavoidable due to:

    - **Similarity of Roles:** The new job responsibilities are so similar to the old ones that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the employee to perform the new job without drawing upon or disclosing the former employer's confidential information.
    - **Employee's Knowledge:** The employee had extensive access to and intimate knowledge of the former employer's highly sensitive trade secrets (e.g., strategic plans, pricing strategies, customer lists, unique manufacturing processes).
    - **Competition:** The new employer is a direct competitor offering similar products or services.
    - **Lack of Trustworthiness/Bad Faith (in some jurisdictions):** While the doctrine can apply even without intent to misappropriate, some courts look for evidence of deceit or a lack of trustworthiness on the employee's part, which could suggest an unwillingness to protect the former employer's secrets.

### Examples

- **Senior Executive Joining a Direct Competitor:** A vice president of sales for a beverage company who has intimate knowledge of their former employer's upcoming marketing campaigns, distribution strategies, and new product development joins a direct competitor in a similar executive role. A court might find it inevitable that they would use this knowledge, even if unintentionally, to benefit the new company.- **Highly Specialized Engineer:** A lead engineer with access to proprietary manufacturing processes and product designs for a tech company leaves to join a rival firm producing very similar products. It might be argued that their expertise is so intertwined with the former company's trade secrets that they cannot help but apply that knowledge in their new role.
- **Pharmaceutical Scientist:** A scientist with deep knowledge of a pharmaceutical company's confidential drug formulations and clinical trial data takes a position with a competing drug developer working on similar compounds.

#### Controversy and Limitations

The inevitable disclosure doctrine is highly controversial and not universally accepted across all U.S. states or by all federal courts. Critics argue that it effectively creates a "de facto" non-compete agreement where none existed, restricting employee mobility and their right to pursue their chosen career.

Courts that are reluctant to apply the doctrine often emphasize the public policy favoring employee mobility and the need for clear evidence of threatened misappropriation beyond just an employee possessing knowledge and taking a similar job.

Therefore, while a powerful tool for trade secret protection, its application is highly fact-specific, varies by jurisdiction, and is generally used in rare circumstances. Employers seeking to rely on this doctrine must be prepared to present strong evidence demonstrating the inevitability of disclosure.
