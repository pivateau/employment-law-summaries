# Age Discrimination

The **federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA)** prohibits discrimination against employees who are **age 40 or over**. This law is similar in operation to the general Title VII provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, but it specifically allows for preferences in favor of older workers.

## Coverage and Scope

- **Employers Covered**: The ADEA applies to employers that have **20 or more employees** for each working day in at least 20 weeks in the current or preceding calendar year. This threshold differs from Title VII, which applies to employers with 15 or more employees. Like Title VII, this numerosity requirement is an element of the plaintiff's claim, not a jurisdictional hurdle.

- **Protected Group**: Individuals who are **40 years of age or older** are protected.

- **Prohibited Discrimination**: The ADEA prohibits age-based discrimination in various employment aspects, including hiring, promotion, compensation, retirement, layoff, discharge, and all other terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. Discrimination in apprenticeship programs is also prohibited.

- **Mandatory Retirement**: Generally, employers cannot force mandatory retirement unless the employee past age 40 is no longer capable of performing the job. A narrow exception exists for employees aged 65 or older who were in executive or high policymaking positions for at least two years before retirement, provided they are entitled to significant annual retirement benefits. Safety reasons can justify a mandatory retirement age, such as for airline pilots, but cannot be used as a pretext for forcing older employees to retire.

- **Retaliation**: The ADEA also prohibits employers from retaliating against employees for exercising their rights or filing a claim under the Act.

## Permitted Practices and Defenses

The ADEA allows for certain employment policies and decisions based on age, though courts interpret these defenses narrowly.

- **Bona Fide Seniority Systems**: Employers may use a bona fide seniority system, even if it adversely affects some workers over age 40, as long as it is not intended to evade the ADEA's purposes.

- **Employee Benefit Plans**: Benefits under a bona fide employee benefit plan may be adjusted based on age using an "equal benefits or equal costs" principle. For example, health insurance benefits for retirees can be eliminated or reduced at age 65 when they become eligible for Medicare.

- **Voluntary Early Retirement Programs**: Employers can establish voluntary early retirement programs, but these incentives must be offered on a nondiscriminatory basis.

- **Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ)**: Similar to Title VII, the ADEA recognizes a BFOQ defense, which applies if the employer reasonably believes that all people over a certain age are unable to perform a job-related task safely, and it is impossible to test individuals over that age safely. Courts have rejected economic considerations (e.g., cost of training older employees) as a basis for a BFOQ.

## Proving Age Discrimination: Key Differences from Title VII

While both ADEA and Title VII cases often utilize the **three-step burden-shifting framework** established in _McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green_ (plaintiff establishes prima facie case, defendant articulates a legitimate non-discriminatory reason, plaintiff proves pretext), a crucial difference lies in the **causation standard** and the **disparate impact defense**.

## Causation Standard: "But-For" Causation

- **ADEA requires "but-for" causation**: To prevail on an age discrimination claim, an employee must demonstrate that **"but for" the employee's age, the employer would not have taken the discriminatory action**. This means age must be the **sole reason** for the employer's action.

- **Title VII allows "mixed-motive" claims**: In contrast, Title VII anti-discrimination claims (e.g., race, sex) can be proven if the plaintiff shows that a protected characteristic was a **"motivating factor"** for the employment practice, even if other factors also motivated the practice. This "mixed motive" standard is **not sufficient** for ADEA claims. The Supreme Court explicitly stated that the ADEA's "because of" language precludes a mixed-motive framework.

- **Stray Remarks**: For a statement to constitute evidence of discrimination, it must be made by a decision-maker and have a nexus between the discriminatory statement and the adverse decision, rather than being a "stray remark".

## Disparate Impact Claims

- **Both ADEA and Title VII allow disparate impact claims**: In these cases, a seemingly neutral business practice disproportionately affects a protected group, even without discriminatory intent.

- **ADEA's "Reasonable Factor Other Than Age (RFOA)" Defense**: This is where ADEA significantly diverges from Title VII.

- For ADEA disparate impact claims, an employer can defend its action by establishing it was based on a **"Reasonable Factor Other than Age" (RFOA)**.
- The **employer bears both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion** for the RFOA defense.
- Crucially, the RFOA defense does **not** **require the employer to show that there is no equally valid, less discriminatory alternative practice**. This differs from Title VII's "business necessity" test, which requires the employer to prove the practice is job-related and consistent with business necessity, and then the plaintiff can rebut by showing a less discriminatory alternative exists. The Supreme Court has stated that the "business necessity test has no place in ADEA disparate impact cases".
- **Practical Impact**: This standard can make ADEA disparate impact cases "harder and costlier for employers to defend" than if the burden were on plaintiffs to show a less discriminatory alternative. When successful, the RFOA defense typically involves showing that a reduction in force was based on performance evaluations designed to retain employees best able to perform remaining work, or other legitimate business reasons like lack of qualifications or loss of funding.
