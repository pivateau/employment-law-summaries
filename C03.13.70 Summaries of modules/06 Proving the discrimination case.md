# Proving the discrimination case

Proving a discrimination claim in employment law typically involves specific legal frameworks designed to balance the rights of employees against the legitimate interests of employers. These frameworks include a burden-shifting process, which is applied to different types of discrimination claims, namely disparate treatment and disparate impact.

## Burden-Shifting Process

In most employment discrimination cases, the burden of proof shifts between the plaintiff employee and the defendant employer. This process involves three primary steps:

1. **Plaintiff's _Prima Facie_ Case:** The plaintiff must first make an initial showing, or establish a **_prima facie_ case**, of employment discrimination. This is considered a "low hurdle to overcome" and creates a presumption of discrimination, though it does not definitively prove that discrimination occurred. Generally, a plaintiff needs to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they are a **member of a protected class**, suffered an **adverse employment action**, and the challenged action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an **inference of discrimination**. An inference of discrimination can arise from an employer's favoritism toward a similarly situated employee who is not part of the protected class.
2. **Employer's Articulated Defense:** Proving the _prima facie_ case shifts the **burden of production** to the defendant employer. The employer must then articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.
3. **Plaintiff's Showing of Pretext:** If the employer articulates such a reason, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff. The plaintiff may challenge that defense by establishing that the employer’s reason is **pretextual**.

### Disparate Treatment Claim

**Disparate treatment** involves a policy or action that is discriminatory on its face, meaning an employer **intentionally treats similarly situated individuals differently** based on a protected characteristic. This is the "most easily understood type of discrimination" and primarily focuses on proving a discriminatory motive.

- **Elements:** To establish a _prima facie_ case, the plaintiff must generally show:

  - They belong to a **protected class**.
  - They suffered an **adverse employment action**.
  - The circumstances give rise to an **inference of discrimination**
  - They suffered damages as a result
    - The Supreme Court, in _Muldrow v. City of Saint Louis_, has lowered the threshold for "adverse employment actions," indicating that plaintiffs no longer need to show "significant harm" but rather "some" harm, though the precise definition of "some" harm remains unclear. Examples of "some harm" could include job transfers, changes in schedule (days to nights, weekdays to weekends), or changes in supervisory duties or advancement opportunities.

### Employer Defense

Once a _prima facie_ case is established, the employer must articulate a **legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason** **(LNDR)** for its actions. An employer seeking to establish an LNDR must show that the adverse employment action was taken for reasons unrelated to discrimination.

The LNDR defense is an employer's assertion that its adverse employment action (e.g., termination, failure to hire, demotion, non-promotion) was based on a lawful, non-discriminatory reason, and _not_ on the employee's protected characteristic (e.g., race, sex, age, religion, national origin, disability).

This reason must be clear, specific, and capable of objective verification. The employer does _not_ need to prove that its reason was true or that it was the _best_ decision, only that it was non-discriminatory.

- **Examples of common LNDRs:**
  - Poor job performance (e.g., failing to meet sales quotas, frequent errors, not following company policy).
  - Lack of qualifications for the position.
  - Misconduct or violation of company policy (e.g., insubordination, theft, attendance issues).
  - Reduction in force or legitimate business restructuring.
  - Better qualifications of another candidate.
  - Budgetary constraints.
  - Tardiness or absenteeism.

### Bona Fide Occupational Qualification

- The **Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ)** is a very narrow and rarely successful defense to employment discrimination claims, specifically those alleging **disparate treatment**.
  - It's an **affirmative defense** under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act - ADEA). This means the employer admits to discriminating based on a protected characteristic but argues that such discrimination is legally permissible because the characteristic is "reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise."
  - Essentially, the employer claims that only individuals with a specific protected characteristic can perform the job's essential duties.

**Which Protected Characteristics it Applies To:**

- Sex (gender)
- Religion
- National Origin
- Age (under the ADEA)
- **It NEVER applies to Race or Color.** Courts and the EEOC have consistently held that race or color can never be a BFOQ, meaning an employer can never justify discrimination based on these characteristics.
**How it's Applied in Disparate Treatment Claims:**

When an employee alleges disparate treatment based on sex, religion, national origin, or age, and the employer admits to the discrimination but asserts a BFOQ, the employer bears a heavy burden to prove:

1. **The "Essence of the Business" Would Be Undermined:** The employer must demonstrate that the discriminatory qualification relates to the fundamental purpose or "essence" of their business. It's not enough to show that it's merely convenient or preferred.

2. **"All or Substantially All" of the Excluded Class Cannot Perform the Job:** The employer must prove that all or virtually all individuals of the excluded group are unable to perform the job's essential duties safely and efficiently. This is a very high bar and generally cannot be based on stereotypes or generalized assumptions.

3. **No Less Discriminatory Alternative:** The employer must show that there is no reasonable alternative that would allow them to achieve their legitimate business objective without discriminating.

**Common Scenarios Where BFOQ Might Be Considered (and often still limited):**

- **Authenticity/Privacy/Decency:**
  - **Actors/Models:** Hiring a specific gender or age for a role where authenticity is crucial (e.g., an actress for a female role, a male model for men's clothing).
  - **Bathroom Attendants/Locker Room Staff:** Requiring attendants of the same sex as the patrons for privacy reasons.
  - **Counselors in Shelters:** Requiring staff of a particular gender in shelters for victims of domestic violence of that same gender.
- **Religious Institutions:** A religious organization may be able to require that employees in certain positions (e.g., ministers, teachers of religious doctrine) adhere to the tenets of their faith. However, this typically wouldn't extend to secular roles like janitors or accountants within the organization.
- **Safety (particularly for age):**
  - **Airline Pilots/Bus Drivers:** Mandatory retirement ages may be upheld as BFOQs due to safety concerns regarding the decline of certain physical and mental functions with age, where individual testing is impractical.
**What is NOT a BFOQ:**

- **Customer Preference:** The most common argument rejected is "customer preference." For example, an airline cannot justify hiring only female flight attendants because customers prefer them (as famously ruled in _Diaz v. Pan American World Airways_).
- **Stereotypes:** Assuming a group is inherently less capable (e.g., women are too weak for a certain job, or men are not nurturing enough).
- **Cost/Inconvenience:** It's too expensive or inconvenient to accommodate individuals of the excluded group.
- **Lack of Separate Facilities:** The absence of separate restrooms or changing facilities is generally not a valid BFOQ defense.

**Why it's so Narrowly Construed:**

The BFOQ defense is a very limited exception because it allows for intentional discrimination, which is fundamentally at odds with the purpose of anti-discrimination laws. Courts and enforcement agencies like the EEOC interpret it strictly to prevent employers from using it as a loophole to perpetuate bias.

### Plaintiff's rebuttal

- **Plaintiff's Rebuttal (Overcoming the Defense):** The plaintiff can **overcome this defense** by demonstrating that the employer's stated reason was "merely pretextual". This can be achieved by showing "such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer’s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons".

### Disparate Impact Claim

**Disparate impact** occurs when policies, practices, rules, or other systems that **appear to be neutral** on their face result in a **disproportionate negative impact** on a protected group. Unlike disparate treatment, disparate impact claims **do not require proof of intentional discrimination**. The law of disparate impact regulates screening devices -- any device that is used to screen out potential candidates. A screening device may be a physical requirement, a scored test, or even an interview.

- **Elements:** The plaintiff's initial burden is to demonstrate that a **particular employment practice caused the disproportionate exclusion** of protected group members, typically through statistical evidence. A common metric for this is the **"four-fifths (or 80%) rule,"** where a selection rate for any group less than 80% of the highest selection rate for another group may indicate disparate impact.
- **Employer Defense:** If disparate impact is shown, the employer can defend itself by proving "business necessity." An employer does this by demonstrating that the challenged practice is **"job-related" and "consistent with business necessity"**. This means establishing a substantial relationship between the requirement and the type of job.
- **Plaintiff's Rebuttal (Overcoming the Defense):** Even if the employer establishes business necessity, the plaintiff has "one last option" to **overcome the defense**: proving that an **equally valid, job-related alternative practice exists that causes less disparate impact**.

## Age discrimination defense differs in its disparate impact defense

- **Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) Specifics for Disparate Impact:** For disparate impact claims under the ADEA, a different defense applies. Instead of "business necessity," employers may defend their actions by showing the differentiation is based on a **"Reasonable Factor Other than Age (RFOA)"**. In ADEA disparate impact cases, the **employer bears both the burden of production and persuasion for the RFOA defense**. The "business necessity" test, used in Title VII disparate impact claims, is not applicable to ADEA disparate impact cases. This approach makes it "harder and costlier for employers to defend" against ADEA suits compared to if the burden were on the plaintiffs.
