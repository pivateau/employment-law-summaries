# Private resolution of employment disputes

Private resolution of employment disputes, primarily through **Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)** methods such as **mediation** and **arbitration**, is increasingly prevalent in the employment landscape. These methods aim to offer employers and employees a quicker and more efficient means of resolving workplace conflicts, serving as alternatives to traditional court litigation.

## Mediation in Employment

**Mediation** is a process where a **neutral third party** helps disputing parties reach their own solution, rather than making a decision for them. It is often successful and can be utilized at any stage of a dispute, generally being less expensive than arbitration or litigation. Many employment agreements now mandate participation in mediation before a lawsuit or arbitration can begin. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) also refers employment discrimination disputes to mediation after a charge is filed.

**Advantages of mediation** include:

- **Opportunity for self-determination** by the parties.
- **Reduced costs** compared to litigation.
- **Relationship repair** and improved communication.
- Resolutions tailored to the specific issue, leading to **closure**.
- **Quicker resolution**, often schedulable within weeks, unlike litigation that can take years.
- Allows employees to **tell their side of the story** to a neutral party, an opportunity often lost in litigation.
- Offers **confidentiality**, permitting free communication with little risk of later use against them.
- It is an **informal process** with no procedural formalities, allowing parties to structure it as they see fit.
- Mediators are generally **knowledgeable** about applicable statutes, regulations, and case law, with skills in conducting hearings and familiarity with the workplace environment.

**Disadvantages of mediation** include:

- Arguments that it **deprives parties of due process**.
- Concerns about **unequal bargaining powers** between employers and employees, potentially leading to "take it or leave it" settlements.
- Perceived problems such as **mediator biases**.
- Danger of **physical and psychological harm** due to the volatile nature of disputes.
- Possible **undermining of the guarantee to one's day in court** and the discovery process.
- Potential for **prevention of public stigmatization** of discriminating employers.

## Arbitration in Employment

**Arbitration** involves parties resolving a dispute outside the court system by submitting the controversy to a **neutral third party (arbitrator) or panel**. An arbitration proceeding resembles a trial where each side presents evidence, and the arbitrator renders a decision. Arbitrators are often retired judges or certified attorneys. Arbitration can be considerably **less costly and faster than litigating** an issue in court, which continues to be appealing to employers.

### Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)

Thousands of employment arbitrations occur annually under federal and state statutes. The **Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)** is central to this, generally **requiring courts to enforce arbitration agreements** and arbitral awards. It establishes a "liberal federal policy favoring arbitration". Courts are mandated to "give effect to the contractual rights and expectations of the parties" and enforce agreements according to their terms. When questions arise regarding arbitrability, the FAA dictates that these issues should be **resolved in favor of arbitration**. A court must compel arbitration if a **valid agreement to arbitrate exists, the dispute falls within its scope, and the plaintiff has refused to proceed to arbitration**.

### Interaction with Statutory Rights

Despite the broad favor shown to arbitration, the Supreme Court has clarified that **mandatory arbitration agreements cannot prevent a plaintiff from asserting their statutory rights**. For example, employees who sign arbitration agreements can still bring claims under laws like Title VII (prohibiting discrimination) or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). By agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, an employee "does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum".

Furthermore, even if an employee is bound by an arbitration agreement, the **Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) itself is not bound by that agreement**. The EEOC can still pursue enforcement actions or claims on behalf of the employee in federal court, even seeking remedies specific to the employee.

### Challenges to Arbitration Agreements

The FAA allows for written arbitration agreements to be enforced "save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract". This means an arbitration agreement may be invalidated by **"generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability"**. Challenges to pre-dispute arbitration agreements imposed as conditions of employment often focus on elements like **adhesiveness, one-sidedness, limitations on substantive statutory rights (including damages), unfair prescribed procedures, and burdensome arbitration fees**.

In _Rent-A-Center West, Inc. v. Jackson_, the Supreme Court held that an arbitrator may consider a claim that an arbitration agreement is unconscionable if the employee did not specifically challenge the "delegation provision" (the part of the contract delegating the power to the arbitrator to decide unconscionability questions). A general challenge to the entire agreement's validity will typically result in the arbitrator, not the court, deciding the unconscionability issues.

### Class Action Arbitration

The Supreme Court has addressed whether arbitration agreements can require individual arbitration and waive the right to class or collective actions. In _Epic Systems Corporation v. Lewis_, the Court concluded that the FAA "instructed federal courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms—including terms providing for individualized proceedings". This built upon _AT&T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion_, which recognized that requiring parties to engage in class action suits would undermine arbitration's efficiency. The Court reasoned that class arbitration was not envisioned when the FAA was enacted, and requiring it interferes with the fundamental characteristics of arbitration. Such requirements introduce numerous procedural issues (e.g., class certification, notice, discovery), are inconsistent with conventional arbitration's procedural formality, and are poorly suited to the higher stakes and limited appeal rights of class litigation. The Court found that if parties did not contract for class-wide arbitration, state law may not insist on it.

### National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Arbitration

Following _Epic Systems_, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has held that **class and collective-action waivers in mandatory arbitration agreements do not violate the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)**. Employers are permitted to inform employees that refusal to sign a mandatory arbitration agreement may result in discharge, and they are not prohibited from promulgating such agreements in response to employees opting into collective actions under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) or state wage-and-hour laws. However, employers are still prohibited from taking adverse action against employees for engaging in concerted activity by filing a class or collective action.

The NLRB also defers to arbitrators' decisions in grievances concerning employee discipline or discharge (alleged NLRA violations) when certain conditions are met: the proceedings were fair, parties agreed to be bound, the arbitrator considered the unfair labor practice issue, and the decision is not clearly repugnant to the Act. This reflects a policy of promoting arbitration as an agreed-upon mechanism for dispute resolution.

### Transportation Worker Exception

Section 1 of the FAA includes an **exception for "contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce"**. The Supreme Court, in _Bissonnette v. LePage Bakeries Park St., LLC_ (2024), clarified that a transportation worker does **not need to work in the transportation industry to be exempt from the FAA's arbitration requirement**. The focus is on whether the worker is actively engaged in interstate transportation, regardless of the employer's primary industry.

Building on this, the Oklahoma Supreme Court, in _Mathis v. Kerr_ (2024), applied _Bissonnette_ to conclude that **Amazon delivery drivers are exempt from federal arbitration requirements** because they deliver goods shipped from other states, engaging in interstate commerce. Crucially for Oklahoma employment law, _Mathis v. Kerr_ also determined that, under Oklahoma state law, **workers’ compensation retaliation claims are exempt from arbitration agreements**.

### Exception for Cases of Sexual Harassment

The **Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA)**, signed into law by President Biden on **March 3, 2022**, represented a significant shift in U.S. employment law. It sought to empower survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment by giving them the choice to pursue their claims in court, even if they had previously signed a mandatory arbitration agreement.

Here's a brief overview:

#### Key Provisions and Purpose

- **Invalidates Predispute Arbitration Agreements:** The core of the EFAA is its invalidation of any "predispute arbitration agreement" or "predispute joint-action waiver" that would force a person alleging a sexual assault or sexual harassment dispute into arbitration.
- **Choice for Survivors:** This means that an individual who experiences sexual assault or harassment in a workplace (or other covered context) can now _elect_ to bring their case in a public court, regardless of any arbitration clause they may have signed as part of their employment contract or other agreement _before_ the dispute arose.
- **Applies to Federal, State, and Tribal Law:** The law covers claims filed under federal, state, or tribal law relating to sexual assault or sexual harassment disputes.
- **Covers Class and Collective Actions:** It also prevents the enforcement of predispute waivers that would prohibit a person from participating in a joint, class, or collective action related to these disputes.
- **Court Determines Applicability:** Importantly, the EFAA specifies that a court, not an arbitrator, will determine whether the Act applies to a particular agreement and whether that agreement is valid and enforceable.
- **Retroactive Application:** The law is considered retroactive in that it applies to agreements signed _before_ its enactment date, as long as the dispute or claim _arises or accrues on or after March 3, 2022_.  

#### Context and Impact

- **Response to #MeToo Movement:** The EFAA was a direct result of the #MeToo movement, which brought widespread attention to how mandatory arbitration clauses often silenced victims of sexual misconduct. These clauses often resulted in confidential arbitration proceedings, preventing public scrutiny and accountability for perpetrators and employers.
- **Increased Transparency and Accountability:** By allowing survivors to choose litigation in court, the law aims to increase transparency around sexual assault and harassment claims, potentially leading to greater accountability for individuals and companies.
- **Shift in Power Dynamic:** It shifts power back to the individual, giving them more control over how their claims are resolved, rather than being bound by a prior agreement that might have been signed without full understanding of its implications for such sensitive matters.
- **Still an Option for Arbitration:** It's crucial to note that the EFAA does _not_ ban arbitration for sexual harassment or assault claims entirely. If a survivor _chooses_ to go to arbitration after a dispute arises, they can still do so. The law simply removes the employer's ability to _force_ arbitration based on a predispute agreement.
- **Ongoing Interpretation:** Since its enactment, courts have been interpreting the specific contours of the EFAA, particularly concerning when a "dispute" arises or accrues, and how it applies when sexual harassment claims are brought alongside other types of claims (e.g., wage and hour claims). Some courts have taken a broad view, holding that if a "case" involves a sexual harassment claim, the entire case might be kept out of arbitration.
