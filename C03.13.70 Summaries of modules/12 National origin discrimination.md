# National origin discrimination

The key legal principles underlying the law of national origin discrimination in employment are:

- **Fundamental Prohibition:** Both federal and state laws explicitly prohibit discrimination in employment based on national origin.
- **Governing Laws:** The primary federal law is **Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964**. In Oklahoma, the **Oklahoma Anti-Discrimination Act (OADA)** also prohibits national origin discrimination. Additionally, the **Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)** prohibits certain immigration-related employment practices, including national origin discrimination, and **Executive Order 11246** requires affirmative action based on national origin for certain federal contractors.
- **Scope of Protection:** Discrimination based on national origin is prohibited in **all phases of the employment relationship** under Title VII, including hiring, refusing to hire, discharge, compensation, terms, conditions, privileges, and responsibilities of employment. Employers may not limit, segregate, or classify employees in a way that deprives them of employment opportunities or adversely affects their status because of national origin. IRCA's prohibition is more focused on **hiring, firing, or recruitment/referral for a fee**. Federal contractors covered by Executive Order 11246 are prohibited from discriminating in hiring, promoting, demoting, transferring, recruiting, terminating, training, or paying employees based on national origin.
- **Employer Coverage:**
  - **Title VII** applies to employers with **15 or more employees**.
  - The **OADA** applies to **all public and private employers** in Oklahoma, including those with only one employee.
  - **IRCA** applies to employers with **four or more employees**; those with 15 or more are also covered by Title VII regarding national origin.
  - **Executive Order 11246** covers federal contractors with contracts exceeding $10,000.
- **Definition of National Origin Discrimination:** This is defined as the denial of equal employment opportunity because of an individual's, or their ancestor's, **place of origin**, or because an individual has the **physical, cultural, or linguistic characteristics of a national origin group**. Discrimination can occur between persons of different races or ethnicities or between persons of the same race or ethnicity.
- **Theories for Proving Discrimination:** National origin discrimination can be proven through:
  - **Disparate Treatment:** This involves **intentional discrimination** where an employer treats individuals less favorably because of their national origin. This is typically proven using the **three-step burden-shifting framework** (prima facie case, legitimate non-discriminatory reason, pretext). The prima facie case requires showing membership in a protected class, an adverse employment action, and circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.
  - **Disparate Impact:** This occurs when seemingly neutral policies or practices have a **disproportionate discriminatory effect** on a protected national origin group, even without intent. Statistical evidence is often used. Employers can defend by showing the practice is **job-related and consistent with business necessity**, but the plaintiff can still prevail by showing an equally valid, less discriminatory alternative exists. While not explicitly stated for national origin, the sources describe disparate impact under the general "Proving Discrimination" section and provide examples related to race, implying it is a general theory applicable across protected classes under Title VII.
  - **Pattern or Practice:** This applies to systemic, routine, intentional discrimination. While discussed generally, the sources do not specifically tie this theory to national origin claims in the provided text.
  - **Hostile Work Environment:** National origin harassment is considered a form of discrimination. To be actionable, the harassment must be **so severe or pervasive** that it alters the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment and creates an **abusive working environment**. It must be based on national origin or stem from discriminatory animus. Courts consider the **totality of the circumstances** (frequency, severity, physical threat/humiliation vs. mere offense, interference with work).
- **Specific Issues as Proxies:** Language issues can be a proxy for national origin discrimination.
  - **Accent Discrimination** is permitted only if the accent materially interferes with communication skills necessary for the job.
  - **Fluency Requirements** may also indicate discrimination.
  - **English-Only Rules** are presumed to violate Title VII if they apply to casual conversations between employees on break or not performing a job duty because they are a burdensome term and condition of employment. Such rules may be permissible if they are job-related and consistent with business necessity, such as for safety or client interaction, but employers should weigh business justifications against discriminatory effects and consider alternatives.
- **State vs. Federal Law:** The OADA prohibits national origin discrimination and states it provides the **exclusive remedies within Oklahoma** for such claims, abolishing common law remedies. Oklahoma law generally **resembles federal law** in defining discriminatory practices. The OADA has broader employer coverage (1+ employee) compared to Title VII (15+ employees).
- **Enforcement and Remedies:** Title VII national origin discrimination claims are administered by the EEOC. Claims under the OADA must be filed with the EEOC or state administrative agency within 180 days. IRCA immigration-related discrimination claims are handled by the Office of Special Counsel within the Justice Department, with a 180-day time limit for filing. Remedies for intentional discrimination under Title VII can include compensatory and punitive damages, subject to statutory caps.
