In Oklahoma, **employment at will serves as the foundational common law doctrine for employment relationships**, granting both employers and employees broad freedom in terminating the employment relationship. However, this doctrine is **not absolute and is subject to significant statutory and judicial limitations** that restrict an employer's ability to terminate an at-will employee.

## Foundational Aspect of Employment at Will in Oklahoma

The common law of Oklahoma, like most states, is built upon the employment-at-will doctrine. This doctrine states that an **employee with an employment contract of indefinite duration is free to quit for any reason, or no reason at all, without incurring liability to the employer**. Similarly, the **employer has the corresponding freedom to terminate an at-will employee for any reason, or no reason at all, without incurring liability to the employee**. Such indefinite employment contracts are considered terminable-at-will agreements, meaning they can be terminated without cause at any time without incurring liability for breach of contract. The doctrine is rooted in principles of freedom of contract and the importance of economic growth, forming the foundation of employment in much of the United States.

## Limitations to Employment at Will in Oklahoma

Despite its foundational nature, the employment-at-will doctrine has limits, as both courts and state legislatures have shown ambivalence due to its sometimes-harsh consequences. A wide range of exceptions have been crafted to avoid the doctrine's application when circumstances suggest otherwise.

### Key limitations include

### Employment Contracts

- The presence of an **express employment contract between the parties can alter at-will employment** by specifying the duration of employment. If employment ends without mutual agreement before the term's end, either party may be liable for damages. Specific contract provisions can also define grounds for termination, such as employee violations or "just-cause" discharge reasons like dishonesty, drug/alcohol use, competition, rule violations, fighting, incompetence, or failure to follow orders.
- **Employee handbooks can sometimes create an implied contract**. While many courts generally reject this, Oklahoma has signaled that a handbook may form the basis of a contract under "limited circumstances" if four traditional contract requirements are met: (1) competent parties, (2) consent, (3) a legal object (or "mutual meeting of the minds"), and (4) consideration. However, implied contracts from handbooks only alter the at-will relationship with respect to accrued benefits, and the promises must be definite, not vague assurances.
- **Disclaimers in handbooks**, which state that no provision creates a contractual obligation, must be clear and prominently displayed. Crucially, the **employer's conduct must consistently reinforce the disclaimer's message**; inconsistent actions or representations can negate its effect. The _Russell v. Board of County Com’rs, Carter County_ case highlighted this by noting that a bold, all-caps disclaimer could still be nullified by inconsistent employer conduct.

### **Statutory Exceptions**

- **Illegal Discrimination**: Federal and state anti-discrimination laws restrict the at-will doctrine by prohibiting employment decisions based on protected characteristics like race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status. Oklahoma's Anti-Discrimination Act (OADA) similarly prohibits discrimination based on these factors and genetic information, providing the **exclusive state remedies for employment-based discrimination** and expressly abolishing common law remedies for such claims.
- **Retaliation**: It is illegal to retaliate against an employee for filing a claim, suing under certain statutes, or engaging in protected activities. Oklahoma specifically created a **statutory exception to at-will employment for cases alleging retaliation for filing a workers’ compensation claim**. This includes filing a claim, retaining a lawyer, instituting a proceeding, or testifying in a workers' compensation proceeding. The OADA also prohibits retaliation for opposing discriminatory practices or participating in discrimination investigations/proceedings.
- **Other Statutory Protections**: Various other Oklahoma statutes contain anti-retaliation provisions protecting employees who engage in protected activities, such as reporting child abuse or neglect, discrimination in wages, or violations of specific labor laws.

### **Judicial Public Policy Exception (Burk Tort)**

- In 1989, the Oklahoma Supreme Court established a significant judicial exception in _Burk v. Kmart Corp._, adopting a **public policy exception to the terminable-at-will rule**. This created a new tort claim (known as a "Burk tort") for termination in violation of public policy.
- This exception applies in a "narrow class of cases in which the discharge is contrary to a **clear mandate of public policy as articulated by constitutional, statutory or decisional law**". The public policy of Oklahoma limits an employer's ability to discharge an employee.
- To qualify for a public policy exception, a plaintiff employee must establish five elements: (1) an actual or constructive discharge, (2) of an at-will employee, (3) in significant part for a reason that violates an Oklahoma public policy goal, (4) found in Oklahoma’s constitutional, statutory, or decisional law or in a federal constitutional provision that prescribes a norm of conduct for Oklahoma, and (5) **with no statutory remedy existing that is adequate to protect Oklahoma policy goal**. This "adequacy of statutory remedy" test is crucial, meaning a Burk tort only exists if no adequate statutory remedy protects the policy goal.
- The _Darrow v. Integris Health, Inc._ case limited the Burk exception to matters affecting the **welfare of the State as a whole** that fit within traditional government action limitations.
- Examples of public policy violations include **sexual harassment** (_Collier v. Insignia Fin. Grp._) and violations of **public health and safety** laws, such as those prohibiting unsafe food handling (_Silver v. CPC-Sherwood Manor, Inc._).
- More recently, in _Ho v. Tulsa Spine & Specialty Hospital_, the Oklahoma Supreme Court found that executive orders issued by the Governor during the COVID-19 pandemic, which expressed a public policy of curtailing infectious disease, could serve as a basis for a Burk tort claim when an employee was allegedly fired for refusing to work due to health and safety concerns. However, the court has also rejected attempts to expand public policy to include harms to individuals rather than the general public, especially when legislative remedies exist.

In conclusion, while employment at will forms the bedrock of Oklahoma's employment law, it is extensively limited by a combination of express and implied contracts, specific anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation statutes, and a judicially created public policy exception that safeguards broader societal interests in the workplace. Employers in Oklahoma must navigate these complex exceptions to avoid legal liability.
